<h4>Personal Essay about the cyber security</h4>
<p>With the development of computer science and programming, there is an increasing number <br>
of programs whose purpose of crime: to harm equipment or users. These programs<br>
 are usually installed without your consent and are called viruses. Precisely this name means<br>
 that these programs are capable of replicating themselves, which allows them to multiply in <br>
 the form of viruses and infect an infinite number of devices. It uses the same system as a real<br>
 virus when disguised as another large file.<br><br>
 
In general, the damage caused by these programs can be very diverse, from small messages to <br>
funny messages that can cause massive data loss, computer shutdown, stealing confidential information,<br>
 or irreparable damage to your system. There have been cases where a virus brought down an entire network,<br>
 losing all data.<br><br>

Fortunately, as information and equipment grow in importance in today's society, professional companies <br>
decided to develop the software called cyber security also called the antivirus (which is the basis for <br>
detecting existing viruses). If you find it, you can block or even remove an already infected computer. <br>
Antivirus is almost an essential application. An antivirus is almost an essential application because you <br>
can be exposed to viruses when you surf the Internet, when you browse web pages, or when you download or <br>
run files from a network.<br>
