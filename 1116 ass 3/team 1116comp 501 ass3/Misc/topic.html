<p>
Cybersecurity is important because it protects all categories of data from theft and damage. This includes sensitive data, personally <br>
identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), personal information, intellectual property, data, and governmental<br>
 and industry information systems.<br><br>

Without a cybersecurity program, your organization cannot defend itself against data breach campaigns, making it an irresistible target<br>
 for cybercriminals.<br><br>

Both inherent risk and residual risk is increasing, driven by global connectivity and usage of cloud services, like Amazon Web Services,<br>
 to store sensitive data and personal information. Widespread poor configuration of cloud services paired with increasingly sophisticated <br>
 cyber criminals means the risk that your organization suffers from a successful cyber attack or data breach is on the rise.<br><br>

Gone are the days of simple firewalls and antivirus software being your sole security measures. Business leaders can no longer<br>
 leave information security to cybersecurity professionals. <br><br>

Cyber threats can come from any level of your organization. You must educate your staff about simple social engineering scams <br>
like phishing and more sophisticated cybersecurity attacks like ransomware attacks (think WannaCry) or other malware designed to steal<br>
 intellectual property or personal data.<br><br>

GDPR and other laws mean that cybersecurity is no longer something businesses of any size can ignore. Security incidents regularly <br>
affect businesses of all sizes and often make the front page causing irreversible reputational damage to the companies involved.<br><br>
