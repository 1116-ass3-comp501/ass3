There are many types of threats in cybersecurity. It is very tough to keep up with latest technologies and security<br>
 trends however it is extremely important to protect information from cyber threats.<br><br> There is a form of software
 called malware that can be used to create risks for computer users, the risks can include <br>viruses, worms, etc.<br><br>
 Another type of malware is known as ransomware. In ransomware, an attacker locks the computer system files of <br>
 the victim mostly by encryption and then ask for payment in order to decrypt and unlock the computer system files.<br> <br>
 Another threat is known as phishing in which fraudulent messages or emails that look very similar to the ones from<br>
 known sources are sent. These attacks are random most of the times. The purpose of these messages are to steal <br>
 the data that is sensitive, for example login data and credit card information. <br>
