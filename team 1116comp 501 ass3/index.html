<h1>Cyber Security: The importance of the defence of computer<br> and network</h1>


</ul><p>Cybersecurity is a procedure that defends computers, networks, servers, electronic
 systems,<br> 
mobile devices, and data from attacks that can be spiteful. 
Cybersecurity is also known to keep security of electronic <br>
information and security of
information technology. It also prevents attacks that intend to interrupt the operations of <br>
 system’s or device’s. The importance of cybersecurity keeps growing as there are more <br>
 users, programs and devices increasing in the modern enterprise.	There are different <br>
 sections in cybersecurity like network security, cloud security, application security, <br>
 critical infrastructure security, etc. The future of cybersecurity is very bright due to <br>
 the number of threats and attackers increasing as we get introduced to new technology now <br>
 and then.
